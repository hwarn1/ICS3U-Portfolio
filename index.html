                     In this module I learned the basics of the programming languages, HTML, CSS, and <br> 
											JavaScript. These langauges can be used together to create almost any program, <br>
											and they are the foundation used in the rest of the computer science modules I <br>
											accomplished. The project entitled "Event Invite" and the lessons and challenges <br> 										
											leading up to it were essential in teaching me how to develop a pleasant looking <br>
											webpage like this one, which includes links, images, and text. The JavaScript <br>
											portion of this module has been the foundation for my creative code throughout <br>
											the semester, as it is the language I used to program many of the games and <br>
											simulations I made. Thanks to this module, I can always remember that when starting <br>
											something new, beginning with the basics can be frustrating at first, but it will <br>
											always benefit me as I move forward with strong foundational knowledge of the concept.<br><br> <a href=Mod1.html> View Components </a>

                     In this module I improved my knowledge, understanding, and ability to program with object-oriented code. Throughout this course, the method of programming learned in this module saved me multiple times when my procedural code failed to give the result I had anticipated. This way of storing pieces of information and altering them allowed me to finish assignments quickly and create more effective programs. The 3D shapes portion of this module opened a door for me into new animations that can be included into programs, and the art that can be created through code. In the future, I can use this module to build upon the basic languages I know and make truly great pieces of work in minimal amounts of time."<br><br> <a href=Mod2.html> View Components </a>

                     In this module I became familiarized with GitHub branching and collaborating with other programmers through the use of local and remote branches. This will be essential for future collaborations using GitHub, and is a great reference even when using another platform to work with a team. This module taught me about the usefulness of pushing and pulling versions of code on to other branches, which was put to use in the Hackathon project and can continue to be used in future collaborations. While working through this module, I hit road blocks many times as the challenges became increasingly longer and tougher to accomplish. This forced me to push through and problem solve, while using the resources around me such as past lessons and GitHub command sheets to figure out how to finish the challenge.<br><br> <a href=Mod3.html> View Components </a>

                     In this module I worked with my group members to create a plan and design for how our program was going to look and work. We used our knowledge with p5.js and GitHub repositories and branching to put display the meaning of our game and to put it together. As some team communication withered, our project became more scattered and not everyone was on the same page. To overcome this, we used everyone's strengths to work together to put all of our work into one game and one repository, which was also used to track our issues and progress. In the future, I can use this project to remind myself of the importance of teamwork and how working together can save something that seems broken. The starting questions used for this project, Problem, Idea, Solution, Application, and Tech Stack were crucial foundations that helped use stay on track and continue towards the goal throughout the work period. This method is a good way to help me create a plan for any type of project, and I can always use it in the future.<br><br> <a href=Mod4.html> View Components </a>

                     In this module I explored a different use for programming, that is creating pattern sequences on a microbit. I found this project particularly interesting because it showed a different field of programming and how it ties into other professions, not just creating games or webpages. During the presentation portion of this module, we were required to find some emerging technologies and well as other fields of study that our microbit relates to which made me realize how programming can be used in many areas of study, such as using the light patterns to study human or animal reaction. In the future, I can use my ability to program a microbit to transfer into more challenging technologies that reqiure similar base knowledge. This ability may also help to move into higher roles within a future profession since I already have a skill set that many other people will not have.<br><br> <a href=Mod5.html> View Components </a>

                     In this module I watched a code walkthrough of a 2D Water Ripples simulation done by Professor Dan Shiffman. I used this walkthrough to understand and formulate the program, so that I could then lead a live walkthrough of this code in front of the class. I enjoyed this project because although it was challenging, as it forced me to understand each specific part of the code, it helped deepen my knowledge and understanding of the javascipt language. I now know that I am capable of researching, comprehending, and explaining programs like the 2D Water Ripples code to others. In the future I can use resources like The Coding Train and reference webpages to help myself understand a program like this, and I can use my knowledge of constructing base code to create new programs and explain them to others as well.<br><br> <a href=Mod6.html> View Components </a>

                     In this module I used my knowledge and Khan Academy experience with object-oriented design to create a fully functional Reaction Time Game. At the beginning of this project, I attempted to use base code from another creator and adapt it to make it my own. However, this tactic did not prove useful since the base code used a very different format than what I am used to, so it was hard for me to understand what each piece of code did and how to add to it. For this reason, I decide to create my own Reaction Time Game from scratch, using the base code as a model to remind me of all the different sets of intructions needed for the program to work properly. This method worked out much better and I was able to create and use the main box as an object that is updated and displayed after it is clicked. In the future, I can use my object-oriented programming skills to create new programs with multiple functions in minimal amounts of time.<br><br> <a href=Mod7.html> View Components </a>

Solving a pyraminx 25 times takes lots of time and effort, so this project, though simple, was a challenge for me.
